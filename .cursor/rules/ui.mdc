Language and Layout:
Design the UI in Arabic language with right-to-left (RTL) support.
Image Matching:
If you attach an image with the prompt, the generated UI must match the design in the image (e.g., layout, colors, and styling).
Responsiveness and Adaptiveness:
Make the UI responsive to work on different screen sizes, including large PC screens and small laptop screens.
Ensure the design is adaptive, adjusting not just in size but also in layout when needed (e.g., rearranging elements for smaller screens).
Modular Code Structure:
Do not use functions extensively in the code. Instead, divide the UI into:
Sections: Larger components that organize the page.
Widgets: Smaller, reusable UI pieces stored in the widgets folder of the page or the shared folder if common.
Avoid putting everything in one page or file. Each page should be built from multiple widgets and sections for better organization and readability.
Consistency:

Apply these UI rules consistently across all pages to maintain a unified design and structure.
